              h2  Envelops
              p An envelope is a common packaging item, usually made of thin flat material. It is designed to contain a flat object, such as a letter or card.
              p Traditional envelopes are made from sheets of paper cut to one of three shapes: a rhombus, a short-arm cross, or a kite. These shapes allow for the creation of the envelope structure by folding the sheet sides around a central rectangular area. In this manner, a rectangle-faced enclosure is formed with an arrangement of four flaps on the reverse side
