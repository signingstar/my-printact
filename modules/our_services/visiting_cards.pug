        | Block printing first came to Europe as a method for printing on cloth,
        | where it was common by 1300. Images printed on cloth for religious
        | purposes could be quite large and elaborate. When paper became
        | relatively easily available, around 1400, the medium transferred very
        | quickly to small woodcut religious images and playing cards printed on
        | paper. These prints produced in very large numbers from about 1425 onward
